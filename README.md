# AR-Fly-And-Search
Android Game made with Google ARCore and Unity C#

The app takes the users camera input and imposes an avatar over it. The user must control their avatar with a joystick for x and y plane movements and a slider for z plane movements. One coin object will spawn at a time, the user must pan their camera around to find the object. Once you find the coin, navigate your avatar to capture it. But be careful, because you only have a limited amount of time! Capturing a coin will increment your score and you'll also get a time limit increase. Capture as many coins as you can before the time runs out!
